> _**What** will the application do?_

This project will be able simulate a 2 dimensional physical environment under
the effects of gravity and collisions with other objects. In addition, objects may be 
created by a user, with physical
properties able to be specified by the user.

> _**Who** will use it?_

This project is primarily intended to be used by a younger demographic of students in an 
educational setting, where they can "get their hands dirty" and toy around with various physical
phenomena. However, this project has the aim of being more than a toy, with intended functionality 
including calculations and values, simulating an experimental setting.     

> _**Why** did I decide on this project idea?_

The notion that mathematics, a purely man-made concept, can accurately explain real world phenomena
astounds me. This deep fascination in our own world that we exist in motivated me to further 
explore that concept in another context - through programming.  Not only would working on this
project be something truly exciting for me, it would also be greatly beneficial
to the future of the field. Targeting a younger demographic is a 
key component of this project, with the aim of sparking interest
in this field by demonstrating how fun physical phenomena may be.
Additionally, the prospect of accurately and precisely simulating 
real-world actions would also quite challenging to me.   


####Phase 1: Stories
As a user, I want to...
- [x] see the balls _move_
- [x] _add_ balls to the BallPit
- [x] _delete_ balls from the BallPit
